      Puto Bumbong Recipe is traditionally made from a special variety of
      heirloom sticky or glutinous rice called Pirurutong which has a distinctly
      purple color, soaked in salted water and dried overnight and then poured
      into bumbong or bamboo tubes and then steamed until done or steam rises
      out of the bamboo tubes. It is served topped with butter or margarine and
      shredded coconut mixed with sugar.

      Puto bumbong is the most sought after Kakanin delicacies at Christmas
      time. During the simbang gabi or the Christmas Eve mass, people would line
      up to their favorite stalls outside the church just to have a taste of
      this favorite Pinoy Kakanin.
